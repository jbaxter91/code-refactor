# Goal? Take an already established website and make it more accessible

In this project I was tasked with looking at a companies website and seeing if there was anything that could be done to make the website more accessible.
You should be able to follow my commits and see exactly what was done.  A quick summary is that i found HTML elements that could be made more semantic
and changed them, I fixed the structure so it followed a more logical structure indipendent of style, added alt attributes to all images, and made the title element more concice and descriptive
